# About me

##  👋 Hello, my name is Hanna.

Some time ago I jumped into an amazing world of programming full of interesting challenges and ways to grow.  
That was one of the best decisions I have made in my life!

* Currently studying **Full-Stack Web Development in Spain** :woman_technologist: 🇪🇸.  
Passionate about IT, problem-solving, and teamwork, I am currently advancing my technical skills with a strong focus on web development. I have learned **full-stack development and how to design, build, and deploy end-to-end web applications using the PERN and MERN stacks.**.

* **M.A. degree in Economics** in the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy, Ukraine :ukraine:.  
With a solid foundation in business administration and economics, I am good at data analysis, project management, and critical thinking, skills which I now apply to the tech industry to create efficient, scalable, and user-focused solutions.

* Languages :speech_balloon:: **Fluent in Ukrainian, English, Spanish** and I am currently **learning Japanese**.

You can see more details about me in my LinkedIn profile.  
Feel free to connect with me 🙂.
